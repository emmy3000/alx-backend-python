# ALX Backend Python

Welcome to the ALX Backend Python repository! This space is dedicated to tackling intermediate to advanced challenges and implementing solutions using the Python programming language, primarily focusing on backend frameworks and business logic.

## General Requirements

Before diving into this repository, it's essential to adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Editors:** You are encouraged to use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` as your code editors.

- **Python Version:** All code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `Python 3.7`.

- **File Endings:** Ensure that all your files end with a new line.

- **Shebang Line:** The first line of every file should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.

- **Project Doc:** A mandatory `README.md` file should be present at the root of your project folder.

- **Coding Style:** Your code should adhere to the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5).

- **Executable Files:** All your files must be executable.

- **File Length:** The length of your files will be evaluated using the `wc` command.

- **Documentation for Modules:** Every module should have documentation. You can check this using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`.

- **Documentation for Classes:** Every class should be documented. You can verify this using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`.

- **Documentation for Functions:** All functions, whether inside or outside a class, must be documented. You can confirm this using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`.

Feel free to explore the repository and share your ideas or report any issues if needed. Happy coding!
