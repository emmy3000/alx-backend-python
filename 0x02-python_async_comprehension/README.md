# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

In this section, you'll learn about asynchronous generators, async comprehensions, and how to type-annotate generators in Python.

## How to Write an Asynchronous Generator

An asynchronous generator is a Python function that allows you to asynchronously yield values using the `yield` statement. Here's a basic example of how to create an asynchronous generator:

```python
async def async_generator():
    for i in range(5):
        yield i
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate asynchronous operation
```

## How to Use Async Comprehensions

Async comprehensions are a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows you to create asynchronous comprehensions, similar to list comprehensions, but with await inside. Here's an example of using async comprehensions to gather results from multiple asynchronous tasks:

```python
async def gather_data():
    tasks = [async_task(i) for i in range(10)]
    results = [result async for result in asyncio.gather(*tasks)]
    return results
```

## How to Type-Annotate Generators

Type annotations in Python help you specify the types of variables, arguments, and return values. To type-annotate generators, you can use the Generator type from the typing module. Here's an example:

```python
from typing import Generator

def number_generator(n: int) -> Generator[int, None, None]:
    for i in range(n):
        yield i
```

By specifying the types of the items yielded and the generator itself, you provide better clarity and information for both developers and tools like linters and type checkers.

These are the basics of working with asynchronous generators, async comprehensions, and type annotations for generators in Python.
